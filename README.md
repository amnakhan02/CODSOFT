Here I did perform **Task 1** which is actually a **"NUMBER GUESSING GAME"**. The program would generate any random number itself and would ask the user to guess any number but only for three times. whenever user enters a number the program would generate a message for user to claim that whether user's guess was correct or not.
In **Task 2**, the program was written to make a**CALCULATOR** where user has to write values and operator as an input and program must calculate and perfom the operation according to user demand.
While in **Task 3**, it was a program for managing **STUDENT GRADING SYSTEM** where user has to given names of students and their corresponding grades as an input. meanwhile, the program would retuen the highest and lowest grades to user and also calculates the average of grades. 
Then in **Task 4** we need to perfom **WORD COUNT** operation where when user seect already created or given file then program must display the total words used in that specific file.
Then finally, in **Task 5** we need to prepare **MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM**. user need to select seats, time and number of tickets of available movies
