Here I did perform **Task 1** which is actually a **"NUMBER GUESSING GAME"**. The program would generate any random number itself and would ask the user to guess any number but only for three times. whenever user enters a number the program would generate a message for user to claim that whether user's guess was correct or not.
In **Task 2**, the program was written to make a**CALCULATOR** where user has to write values and operator as an input and program must calculate and perfom the operation according to user demand.
While in **Task 3**, it was a program for managing **STUDENT GRADING SYSTEM** where user has to given names of students and their corresponding grades as an input. meanwhile, the program would retuen the highest and lowest grades to user and also calculates the average of grades.
